    - loot tables use item shears instead of shears tag, meaning sickles wont work fully as shears anymore, though i fixed it for aurorian stuff (leaves, plants)
    - tool tier settings arent possible anymore, config registers after item registry
    - 1.19.3 added DatapackBuiltinEntriesProvider for worldgen, so for now its manual >.>

    to do:
    - silentwood abilities
    - aurorian moon rotation
    - key item models
    - spectral armor transparency
    - dark stone dungeon and mobs
    - moon temple dungeon and mobs
    - ruin structures
    - farming
    - dungeon locator and boss weapons
    - aurorian portal
    - dungeon keeper
    - probably lots more im forgetting...
